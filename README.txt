Chuigda counterpart of lyzh's Cement language, specialised for Windows32 platform.

== Compatibilty notes

This program was mainly developed on Windows XP with VC 6.0, and tested on Windows 98.
Theorically this progeam should work on further Windows NTs.

This program has a known compatibility issue with Visual Studio 2019, due to its
resource file. By this time I have no fix for that. PRs are welecomed.
